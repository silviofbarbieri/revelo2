## Thoughts

In DockerFile, 
    Corrections:
1.     Add the -y directive in apt-get install to permit 
        instalation parameter
        In summary, -y is used to automate the installation, removal, or upgrading of packages, avoiding the need for manual interaction to confirm the actions.

2.  In Run Command 
    trying to modify a setup.py file using the sed command, but there's a problem with the quotes
    Also, the path for setup.py could be better specified forcing with './setup.py'

 3. Fix the issues

 The TDD file create test_csr_round.py contains 

This Python code defines a series of unit tests using the unittest framework to verify the behavior of a hypothetical round() function when applied to scipy.sparse.csr_matrix objects. Let's break down each part:

Imports:

import unittest: Imports the unittest module, which provides tools for writing and running tests.
import numpy as np: Imports the numpy library, commonly used for numerical operations, especially for creating and manipulating arrays. It's aliased as np for easier use.
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix: Imports the csr_matrix class specifically from the scipy.sparse module. CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) is a format for representing sparse matrices efficiently.
Test Class:

class TestCSRMatrixRound(unittest.TestCase):: Defines a test class named TestCSRMatrixRound that inherits from unittest.TestCase. This class will contain individual test methods.
Test Methods:

Each method within this class starts with the prefix test_ and is designed to test a specific aspect of the round() function's interaction with csr_matrix objects.

def test_round_method_exists(self)::

Purpose: Checks if the built-in round() function can be called with a csr_matrix object without raising a TypeError.
How it works: It creates an empty csr_matrix and attempts to call round() on it. If a TypeError occurs, it means the round() function doesn't inherently know how to handle this type, and the test fails.
def test_round_with_integer_data(self)::

Purpose: Tests the behavior of round() when the csr_matrix contains integer data. It expects that the integers should remain unchanged after rounding.
How it works:
It creates a csr_matrix with integer data.
It calls round() on the matrix.
It asserts that the result (rounded) is still a csr_matrix.
It converts both the original and the rounded matrices to dense NumPy arrays using .toarray() and uses np.testing.assert_array_equal() to verify that they are identical.
def test_round_with_float_data(self)::

Purpose: Tests the basic rounding of floating-point data within a csr_matrix.
How it works:
It creates a csr_matrix with floating-point data.
It defines the expected result after rounding (to the nearest integer).
It calls round() on the matrix.
It asserts that the result is a csr_matrix and uses np.testing.assert_array_equal() to compare the rounded matrix (converted to a dense array) with the expected array.
def test_round_with_ndigits(self)::

Purpose: Tests the round() function's ability to handle the optional ndigits parameter, which specifies the number of decimal places to round to.
How it works:
It creates a csr_matrix with floating-point data.
It defines two expected results: one rounded to one decimal place (ndigits=1) and another rounded to two decimal places (ndigits=2).
It calls round() with the respective ndigits values.
It asserts that both results are csr_matrix objects and uses np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal() to compare the rounded matrices with the expected arrays (using "almost equal" due to potential floating-point precision issues).
def test_round_preserves_sparsity(self)::

Purpose: This is a crucial test for sparse matrices. It verifies that the round() operation doesn't change the sparsity pattern of the matrix. In other words, elements that were originally zero should remain zero after rounding.
How it works:
It creates a csr_matrix with some non-zero floating-point values.
It calls round() on the matrix.
It converts both the original and the rounded matrices to dense arrays.
It iterates through all the elements of the original matrix. If an element is zero, it asserts that the corresponding element in the rounded matrix is also zero.
Main Execution Block:

if __name__ == "__main__":: This standard Python construct ensures that the code inside this block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).
unittest.main(): This function discovers and runs all the tests defined in the current module (i.e., the TestCSRMatrixRound class).
In essence, this code tests whether a round() function (presumably one that is either built-in or has been implemented to handle csr_matrix objects) works correctly by:

Checking if it can be called without errors.
Verifying that it doesn't change integer data.
Ensuring it rounds floating-point data to the nearest integer.
Testing its behavior with a specified number of decimal places.
Confirming that it maintains the sparse structure of the matrix (zeros remain zeros).
